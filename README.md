# Efficient Implementation of Graph Homomorphism Counting Algorithm

## Description

This C++ library computes the number of graph homomorphisms between two graphs H and G using Diaz, Serna and Thilikos's dynamic programming algorithm on a nice tree decomposition. Greedy heuristics are used to find a tree decomposition. 
<br><br>The complexity of this algorithm is polynomial to the treewdith of the NTD - O(poly(|V(H)|)\*|V(G)|^{tw(H)+1}). If H is a tree, the complexity becomes O(|V(H)|\*|E(G)|).
<br><br>Pybind11 is used to run this library in a Python environment.

## Usage

Define Graph by the number of vertices and add edges using addEdge:
````
from homlib import Graph, countHom

H = Graph(3)
H.addEdge(0, 1)
H.addEdge(1, 2)

G = Graph(3)
G.addEdge(0, 1)
G.addEdge(1, 2)
G.addEdge(2, 0)

print(countHom(H, G))

<br>Define Graph by the adjacency matrix:
````
from homlib import Graph, countHom

H = Graph([
    [7, 8, 9],
    [5, 8, 9],
    [5, 6, 9],
    [5, 6, 7],
    [6, 7, 8],
    [1, 2, 3],
    [2, 3, 4],
    [0, 3, 4],
    [0, 1, 4],
    [0, 1, 2],
])

G = Graph([
    [1, 2, 4, 8, 9, 10],
    [0, 2, 5, 7, 9, 11],
    [0, 1, 3, 7, 8, 11],
    [2, 6, 7, 8, 10],
    [0, 5, 6, 8, 11],
    [1, 4, 6, 8, 10],
    [3, 4, 5, 10],
    [1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 11],
    [0, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10],
    [0, 1, 8, 10, 11],
    [0, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9],
    [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]
])

print(countHom(H, G))
